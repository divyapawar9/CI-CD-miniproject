Deploy a website automatically to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions

# CI/CD Static Website Deployment using GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a basic Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to automatically deploy a static website to **GitHub Pages**.
I have added here two static website miniprojects, one is protfolio and other one is game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Deploys a static `game.html` and `portfolio.html` webpage to GitHub Pages.
- Uses GitHub Actions to trigger deployment on every push to the `main` branch.
- Implements automation with YAML-based workflow configuration.
- No manual deployments — everything is continuous and automated.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **GitHub Actions** – for CI/CD automation
- **GitHub Pages** – for hosting the static site
- **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** – for the website content
- **YAML** – for configuring the workflow
- **Git** – for version control
